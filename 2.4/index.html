        <section id="sintese"> 
            <p> In reference to Ted Nelson’s “Literary Machines” and Robert Coover’s “The End of 
                Books”, this page seeks to correlate the main concepts presented in both essays.</p>
            <p> At a time highly marked by technological reliance and development, both authors 
                highlight a possible future outcome, specifically in relation to hypertext.</p>

        <div id="hypertext">
            <p>“The link facility given us much more than the attachment of mere odds and ends. 
                It permits fully non-sequential writing, or <em>hypertext</em>.” [1]</p>

            <p><em>Hypertext</em> is “the writing done in the nonlinear or nonsequential space made possible
                by the computer. Moreover, unlike print text, <em>hypertext</em> provides multiple paths between text
                segments.”[2]</p>

        <div id="literary"> 
            <p>“A <em>literature</em> is a <em>system</em> of interconnected writings. We do not offer this as our definition, 
                but as a discovered fact. And almost all writing is part of some <em>literature</em>." [1]</p>

            <p>“What resulted from the confrontation between an unusual <em>hypertext</em> writing opportunity and a well-read, 
                conservative student was, Coover found, high-quality and copious <em>literary</em> output.” [2]</p>
        </div>

        <div id="interactive">
            <p>"It is difficult to describe an <em>interactive</em> computer <em>system</em> so people can visualize it." [1]</p>
            <p>"(...) <em>hypertext</em> presents a radically divergent technology, <em>interactive</em> and polyvocal, favoring a plurality
                of discourses over definitive utterance and freeing the reader from domination by the author." [2]</p>
        </div>

        <div id="structure">
            <p>“So the problem is to create a general representation and storage <em>system</em> that will permit automatic storage
                of all <em>structures</em> a user might want to work on, and the faithful accounting of their development.” [1]</p>
            
            <p>“With <em>hypertext</em> we focus, both as writers and as readers, on <em>structure</em> as much as on prose, for we are made 
                aware suddenly of the shapes of narratives that are often hidden in print stories." [2]</p>
        </div>

        <div id="display">
            <p>“Thereafter, when he <em>displays</em> either piece of text, and asks to see the links, a link-symbol is <em>displayed</em>, 
                and the other attached text—if he wishes to see it.” [1]</p>
            
            <p>“The traditional narrative time line vanishes into a geographical landscape or exitless maze, with beginnings,
                middles and ends being no longer part of the immediate <em>display</em>.” [2]</p>
        </div>

        <div id="document">
            <p>“Everyone will have the ability to produce their own <em>documents</em> and connect them to any other public <em>documents</em>.  
                The author may constantly create new versions of her own <em>documents</em>, and individuals may create their own versions 
                of any public <em>document</em>, including the creation of new <em>documents</em> that include by reference elements of many <em>documents</em>
                by many authors; public connections made between one version of one <em>document</em> and another version of another will 
                usually automatically place themselves in all the extant versions.” [1]</p>

            <p>“Print <em>documents</em> may be read in hyperspace, but <em>hypertext</em> does not translate into print." [2]</p>
        </div>

        <div id="system">
            <p>“(...) <em>systems</em> such as Xanadu: links of multiple types, into specific <em>document</em> locations that need not be pre-marked
                 with anchors; the ability to find resources by name, rather than URL; and further separation of front end and back end functions." [1]</p>
            
            <p>“The most radical new element that comes to the fore in <em>hypertext</em> is the <em>system</em> of multidirectional and often 
                labyrinthine linkages we are invited or obliged to create.” [2]</p>
