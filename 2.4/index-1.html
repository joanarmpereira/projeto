        <section id="sintese"> 
            <p>Based on excerpts from Allan Kaprow’s ‘Happenings’ in the New York Scene and Joseph
                C.R. Licklider’s Man-Computer Symbiosis, this page not only highlights key-words 
                from each of the texts, but also makes a parallel between the concepts and their 
                different meanings in each author.</p>
            <p> Through a mediating index, each concept is presented and compared according to 
                several quotes from both texts, in which all key-words are highlighted and linked 
                between each other.</p>

        <div id="interaction-k">
            <p>The “idea of interaction associated with Happenings was profoundly inspiring and has remained 
                so for decades.” And “(...) the work Kaprow reports does not necessarily employ interaction in
                 the service of something besides the creation of a new experi- ence and type of attention (...)”. 
                 “In both cases the inter- active method comes from outside the community (...)”.</p>

            <p>“The artistic material of inter- active art is the automatized dialogue between program and user.“</p>
        </div>

        <div id="interaction-l">
            <p>“Licklider soon became a force in promoting computer science education, time- sharing systems, 
                interactive computing, and computer networks.” For this author, “Man-computer symbiosis is an expected 
                development in cooperative interaction between men and electronic computers.”</p>

            <p>“If those problems can be solved in such a way as to create a symbiotic relation between a man and a 
                fast information-retrieval and data-processing machine, however, it seems evident that the cooperative 
                interaction would greatly improve the thinking process.”</p>
        </div>


        <div id="participation-k"> 
            <p>“Kaprow’s Happenings make abundantly clear that not every form of participation per se implies a higher 
                responsibility for the visitor and thus a less authoritarian role of the artist. Rather, participation 
                is located along a fragile border between emancipatory act and manipulation.”</p>

            <p>“The widespread judgment that interactive intercourse with computer systems prepares the ground for an 
                emancipation from the media context, via the development from ‘passive’ to ‘active’ reception, is being 
                euphorically defended by referring to the participatory art of the sixties.” [3]</p>
        </div>

        <div id="participation-l"> 
            <p>Licklider talked about the “Need for Computer Participation in Formulative and Real-Time Thinking.”</p>

            <p>Therefore, he expressed the importance to “(...) bring com- puting machines effectively into processes 
                of thinking that must go on in “real time,” time that moves too fast to permit using computers in 
                conventional ways.”</p>
        </div>


        <div id="instruction-k">
            <p>”The decisive factor in judging the receptive situation is how active the unprepared viewer becomes within a certain framework 
                of action and without specific instructions...”</p>
        </div>

        <div id="instruction-l">
            <p>“The idea may be highlighted by comparing instructions ordinarily addressed to intelligent human beings with instructions 
                ordinarily used with computers. “</p>
            
            <p>“The former present or imply something about incentive or motivation, and they supply a criterion by which the human executor 
                of the instructions will know when he has accomplished his task.”</p>

            <p>“In short: instructions directed to computers specify courses; instructions directed to human beings specify goals.”</p>  
        </div>


        <div id="experience-k">
            <p>“(...) the work Kaprow reports does not necessarily employ interaction in the service of something besides the creation 
                of a new experience and type of attention (...)”</p>
            
            <p>“(...) Happenings cannot be sold and taken home; they can only be supported. And because of their intimate and fleeting 
                nature, only a few people can experience them.” “One is also left exposed to the quite marvelous experi- ence of being surprised.”</p>
        </div>

        <div id="experience-l">
            <p>“(...) in gathering data on which to base a decision, for example, both the man and the computer came up with relevant precedents 
                from experience and if the computer then suggested a course of action that agreed with the man’s intuitive judgment.”</p>

            <p>“Engineers who have had experience in the field of automatic speech recognition take a conservative attitude toward the feasibility.”</p>
        </div>


        <div id="communication-k">
            <p>“Interactive artworks provide a critical analysis of the automatized communication that is replacing interhuman relationships 
                in more and more social fields.”</p>
        </div>

        <div id="communication-l">
            <p><p>Licklider “(...) began another important article, “The Computer as a Communication Device,” with a bold statement: “In a few years, 
                men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face.” “The article argued against communication as being 
                a simple one-way process between sender and receiver.”</p></p>
            
            <p>“For the purposes of real-time cooperation between men and computers, it will be necessary, however, to make use of an additional and rather 
                different principle of communication and control.”</p>
        </div>


        <div id="media-k">
            <p>“The “Happenings” are a touchstone for nearly every discussion of new media as it relates to interactivity in art.”</p>
            
            <p>“Happenings achieved such fame, beyond those who participated directly, because they reflected and provoked a desire to breakdown distinctions 
                between creator and audience—a desire and activity now central for many new media practitioners.” “Allan Kaprow’s use of the term happening 
                in 1959 was picked up by the media and the art world and applied to various performances and events.” [4]</p>
        </div>

        <div id="media-l">
            <p>“Licklider soon became a force (...) in promoting more visionary extensions of computing as new media.”</p>
